## I want to contribute to *ReviewMonitor*
If you want to make this project more awesome, you can start looking into open github issues. We usually tag issues that are ready to be worked on with [You can do it](https://github.com/RishabhTayal/ReviewMonitor/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22you+can+do+it%22) label. This is a good begining place for first time contributors. 

## Pull Requests
All changes should be made off of the latest version of `master`. If a Pull Request is still being worked on then please make this obvious by including "WIP" in the title!

Pull Requests should have a suitable amount of testing done to ensure it doesn't break the app, and we do appreciate new unit tests being created although this isn't currently enforced in the aim of releasing faster!

## Issues

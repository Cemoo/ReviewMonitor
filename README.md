# ReviewMonitor

ReviewMonitor is an iOS app to manage your iTunes Connect account on the go. The Apple iTunes Connect iOS app is nice, but lacks lot of features like:

- TestFlight build management.
- Submitting build for App Store/TestFlight review.
- View App Store reviews and respond to them.
- Support for multiple account login.

This project aims to make an iOS app which is more powerful than the Apple's official iTunes Connect app. Some features like multiple account login are already implemented.

> **This app won't be published on the App Store. Apple won't allow an app which asks users to login with their iTunes Connect account and use of unauthorized iTunes Connect web APIs.**
